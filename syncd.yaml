# Sync Daemon Configuration
#
# This is a sample configuration file for the sync daemon.
# 
# CONFIG FILE LOCATIONS (searched in order):
# 1. ./sync_daemon.yaml (current directory)
# 2. ~/.config/sync_daemon/config.yaml (user's config directory)
# 3. /etc/sync_daemon/config.yaml (system-wide config)
#
# REQUIRED CONFIGURATION:
# - host_groups: At least one group with hosts and directories
#   - hosts: At least one host per group
#   - directories: At least one directory per group with local and remote paths
#
# GLOBAL SETTINGS (all optional):
# - daemon: false                    # Run as daemon in background
# - log_level: "info"               # Logging levels: trace, debug, info, warn, error
# - log_file: "/var/log/sync_daemon.log"  # Log file path (if not set, logs to console only)
# - pid_file: "/var/run/sync_daemon.pid"  # Process ID file location
# - host_check_interval: 300        # How often to check if hosts are responsive (seconds)
# - consistency_check_interval: 3600 # Full consistency check interval (seconds)
# - noop: false                     # Dry-run mode, don't actually sync
#
# DIRECTORY CONFIGURATION (per directory):
# - local: "/path/to/dir"           # Required: Local directory path
# - remote: "/remote/path"          # Required: Remote directory path
# - sync_type: "batch"              # Optional: 'batch' (default) or 'event'
# - batch_interval: 300             # Optional: Sync interval for batch mode (seconds)
# - exclude: []                     # Optional: List of patterns to exclude
#
# UNISON OPTIONS:
# Default options are provided below but can be overridden. Common options:
# -batch              # Run without user interaction
# -prefer newer       # Keep newest version on both sides
# -times             # Preserve modification times
# -perms 0           # Don't sync permissions
# -auto              # Automatically accept actions
# -ui text           # Use text UI
# -fastcheck true    # Quick update detection
# -confirmbigdel     # Confirm large deletes
# -silent            # Reduce output verbosity
# -ignore 'Pattern'  # Ignore patterns (auto-generated from exclude lists)
#
# SYNC TYPES:
# 1. batch (default):
#    - Changes are synced periodically based on batch_interval
#    - Default interval is 300 seconds (5 minutes)
#    - Good for: large directories, frequent changes, or limited resources
#
# 2. event:
#    - Changes are synced in near real-time
#    - Small batching window (2 seconds) to prevent excessive syncs
#    - Good for: immediate sync needs, development work
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
# - SSH keys must be properly configured for all hosts
# - Unison must be installed on all hosts
# - Remote paths must be accessible to the SSH user
# - Log directory must be writable if log_file is specified
# - PID directory must be writable if running as daemon
